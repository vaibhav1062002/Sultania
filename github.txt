Benefits of Collaborating
   Your Team is collaborating to your code.
   Hence Project Development is faster.

7 Steps of Collaboration

1. Fork the target repo to your own account.
2. Clone the repo to your local machine.
 git clone repolink

3. Check out a new "topic branch" and make changes.
 git checkout -b checkout_page

4. Stage and Commit Your Changes.
git add .


5. Committing 
 git commit -am "checkout page done"

Step 6: Pushing
 git push origin checkout_page


Step 7: Creating a Pull Request (PR)

 Use the diff viewer on GitHub to create a pull request via a       discussion.
6. Make any requested changes.
7. The pull request is then merged (usually into the master    branch) and the topic branch is    deleted from the upstream    (target) repo.
